Scraper to pull misdemeanor data from Travis County Clerk's office

This is a scraper to pull misdemeanor data from Travis County Clerk's 
office website, and shows two methods of pulling the data from the websites.
It pulls three types of web pages: 
  1) The summary of defendants by date, 
  2) the defendant's details, and 
  3) the defendant's disposition details. 
Finally, the program outputs the three datasets to csv files.
